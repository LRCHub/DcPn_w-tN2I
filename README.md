[00:04.11] Something 'bout ya
[00:07.72] I cannot pretend
[00:11.24] I cannot pretend
[00:18.05] Something 'bout ya
[00:21.64] Can’t get out my head
[00:25.19] Can't get out my head
[00:35.69] 
[00:28.54] And if you do come back
[00:35.16] May your forehead touch the ground
[00:38.82] Again and again
[00:42.26] And surely even then
[00:49.30] Ain't no room for friends
[00:52.69] And you know this to the end
[00:57.64] To the end
[01:02.64] 
[00:58.13] Ooh
[01:04.25] Ooh
[01:07.64] Ooh
[01:11.98] Ooh
[01:18.09] Ooh
[01:21.54] Ooh
